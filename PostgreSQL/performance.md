In most cases, **there is no significant performance difference** between:

1. Calling a **PostgreSQL function** that contains a SQL query, versus  
2. Running the **same SQL query** directly from your application code.

---

## Why They’re Usually Similar

1. **Query Planning & Optimization**  
   - Whether you put the SQL directly in your code or in a “SQL function” in Postgres, the database still analyzes the same query and tries to find an optimal execution plan.  
   - Postgres may even cache the plan after the first use, so subsequent calls are usually quite efficient.

2. **SQL Function “Inlining”**  
   - For “SQL-language” functions (i.e., `LANGUAGE sql`), Postgres can inline their contents into the calling query in many cases. That means the engine effectively sees the original SQL, so there’s minimal overhead.

3. **PL/pgSQL Overhead**  
   - If your function is written in **PL/pgSQL** (rather than a plain SQL-language function), there’s a small overhead for the function call. In most real-world scenarios, this overhead is still negligible compared to the actual work of the query (e.g., scanning rows, doing joins).

4. **Network Round Trips**  
   - Whether your SQL is inline or in a function, each call to the database typically incurs **at least one** round trip. If you’re calling a function or running a raw query once per operation, the difference is minimal.  
   - If you’re making many calls in a loop from the application, **batching** or using server-side logic (e.g., a stored function or procedure) can be faster because it reduces round trips.

## When Might There Be a Noticeable Difference?

1. **Complex PL/pgSQL Logic**  
   - If the function does complex procedural stuff (loops, conditionals, repeated queries), you might see some overhead. But in simple “one SELECT” functions, it’s negligible.

2. **Older PostgreSQL Versions**  
   - Very old versions of PostgreSQL (pre-9.x) handled function inlining and caching less efficiently. In modern versions, you typically won’t see a big difference.

3. **Repeated Execution**  
   - If you run the same query many times from the application, you may benefit from **prepared statements** or a connection pool that caches query plans. A function can’t automatically reuse an external prepared statement.  
   - On the other hand, if the function has been called before, its plan may also be cached on the server side.

## Practical Recommendation

- **Use the approach that’s cleanest for your codebase**: If your logic is better expressed and maintained in a function, do that. If you prefer to keep it in the application layer, that’s also fine.  
- For critical performance scenarios, **benchmark both** approaches on your production-like data. Usually, you’ll see either no difference or very minor differences in execution times.  
- Remember that **good indexing** and **overall query design** almost always matter more than whether you embed the SQL in code or wrap it in a function.


### Pros & Cons of the Window Function Method

- **Pros**:  
  - Demonstrates a “single pass” style, computing both the per-employee task count and the per-project employee count in one flow of window functions.  
  - Can be interesting for certain analytic queries.  

- **Cons**:  
  - It’s still more verbose than a straightforward “two-group” approach (subquery or CTE).  
  - You typically need an extra level of nesting to filter on the window function results (as the `WHERE` clause cannot directly reference a window function).  
  - In many real-world cases, performance and readability might be better with a simple `GROUP BY` subquery or a CTE.

### Summary of All Approaches

1. **Subquery / Derived Table**  
2. **CTE (WITH ...)**  
3. **CASE-based Grouping**  
4. **Window Functions**  

All achieve the goal: **Projects that have at least `N` employees, each with at least `M` tasks.**  
In PostgreSQL, these typically result in **similar query plans** once optimized. Which you pick often depends on **readability** and **team preference**.
