If the `autovacuum_enabled` option is `NULL` (i.e., not explicitly set), it means that the table is using the **default PostgreSQL behavior**, which is `autovacuum_enabled = true`. This means **autovacuum is enabled** for those tables unless explicitly disabled.

---

### **Why This Matters for Benchmarking**
- **Enabled Autovacuum**: If `autovacuum` is enabled, background processes could:
  - Access the table during your benchmarking queries.
  - Load pages into the shared buffer cache.
  - Potentially affect query performance due to concurrent operations.

- **Disabled Autovacuum**: Prevents these background processes from interfering, ensuring a clean and isolated environment for benchmarking.

---

### **What to Do**
If you want to **ensure no interference** from `autovacuum`, explicitly disable it for the tables:

1. Disable `autovacuum` for the specific tables:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employee SET (autovacuum_enabled = false);
   ALTER TABLE employeeproject SET (autovacuum_enabled = false);
   ```

2. Verify the change:
   ```sql
   SELECT relname, reloptions
   FROM pg_class
   WHERE relname IN ('employee', 'employeeproject');
   ```

   - Expected Output:
     ```
     relname          | reloptions
     -----------------+------------------------
     employee         | {autovacuum_enabled=false}
     employeeproject  | {autovacuum_enabled=false}
     ```

3. After Benchmarking: Re-enable `autovacuum` to avoid table bloat:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employee SET (autovacuum_enabled = true);
   ALTER TABLE employeeproject SET (autovacuum_enabled = true);
   ```

---

### **Conclusion**
If `reloptions` is `NULL`, it means `autovacuum` **is enabled** by default. For clean benchmarking, explicitly disable it and re-enable it afterward. Let me know if you need more help! ðŸ˜Š

Great! The output:

```plaintext
"employee"        "{autovacuum_enabled=false}"
"employeeproject" "{autovacuum_enabled=false}"
```

confirms that **autovacuum has been successfully disabled** for both `employee` and `employeeproject` tables. This ensures that:

- No background `autovacuum` processes will access these tables during benchmarking.
- The tables will not be preloaded into the shared buffer cache by `autovacuum`.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **Restart the PostgreSQL Server**:
   - Restarting ensures no cached data from previous queries remains in the shared buffer cache:
     ```bash
     ./restart_server.sh
     ```

2. **Run Your Query**:
   - Execute your benchmarking query to analyze cache usage:
     ```sql
     EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE)
     SELECT * 
     FROM employee e 
     WHERE NOT EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 FROM employeeproject ep WHERE ep.employee_id = e.id
     );
     ```

3. **Verify Buffer Usage**:
   - Look for `Buffers: shared hit=0` in the execution phase to confirm that no data was fetched from the shared buffer cache.
   - `shared read` indicates data was read directly from disk.

---

### **After Benchmarking**
Once youâ€™re done, re-enable `autovacuum` for these tables to prevent table bloat:
```sql
ALTER TABLE employee SET (autovacuum_enabled = true);
ALTER TABLE employeeproject SET (autovacuum_enabled = true);
```

The query execution plan still shows **`shared hit=1`** for the `employee` table, even after adding the randomized condition. Here's a detailed analysis of why this happens and what it means for your benchmarking:

---

### **Key Observations**

1. **Execution Buffers**:
   - **`shared hit=1`**: Indicates one page was fetched from the PostgreSQL **shared buffer cache** for the `employee` table.
   - **`shared read=2`**: Indicates two pages were fetched directly from disk.

   **Breakdown**:
   - **`employee`**: `shared hit=1 read=1`
   - **`employeeproject`**: `shared read=1`

2. **Planning Buffers**:
   - **`shared hit=144 read=11`**: Access to system catalogs (e.g., `pg_class`, `pg_attribute`) for query planning led to significant cache usage. This is normal and unrelated to table data retrieval.

3. **Randomized Condition**:
   - The condition (`random() > -1`) was applied during the sequential scan on `employee` (`Filter: (random() > '-1'::double precision)`).
   - However, this did not prevent one page of the `employee` table from being cached.

---

### **Why `shared hit=1` Persists**
1. **Metadata Preloading**:
   - When the `employee` table is accessed, its metadata (e.g., column definitions, constraints) is loaded into shared buffers. If the table is small, a portion of its data may also be preloaded alongside the metadata.

2. **Small Table Size**:
   - For small tables, PostgreSQL often fits the entire table in 1-2 pages (each page is 8 KB by default).
   - Even after restarting the server, PostgreSQL may preload one of these pages during query planning or execution.

3. **Background Processes**:
   - PostgreSQL background processes like the **stats collector** may briefly access the table after a restart, resulting in incidental caching.

---

### **Implications for Benchmarking**
- **Minimal Cache Impact**:
  - A `shared hit=1` for a small table is negligible, as the majority of buffers (`shared read=2`) indicate disk reads.
  - The `random()` condition ensured that query execution was not fully optimized, keeping the benchmark meaningful.

---

### **Next Steps**
If you want to eliminate even the minimal cache hits:
1. **Increase Table Size**:
   - Populate the `employee` table with more rows to span multiple pages:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO employee (name, email) 
     SELECT 'Test User ' || i, 'test' || i || '@example.com'
     FROM generate_series(1, 10000) AS i;
     ```

2. **Preload Unrelated Data**:
   - Use the `pg_prewarm` extension to load unrelated large tables into shared buffers, evicting cached `employee` pages:
     ```sql
     SELECT pg_prewarm('large_unrelated_table', 'main');
     ```

3. **Accept Minimal Hits**:
   - For small tables, a `shared hit=1` is often unavoidable and has minimal impact on benchmarking results.

---

### **Conclusion**
The `shared hit=1` is expected for small tables and is likely due to metadata or incidental caching. Unless benchmarking larger tables, this minimal cache hit can be considered negligible. Let me know if you'd like to test alternative scenarios! ðŸ˜Š

To measure query execution time without the additional overhead introduced by `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE)`, you can use the following approaches to log the time:

---

### **1. Use PostgreSQL's `pg_stat_statements` Extension**
The `pg_stat_statements` extension tracks query execution statistics, including execution time. Hereâ€™s how to enable and use it:

#### **Step 1: Enable the Extension**
1. Edit `postgresql.conf` to include the `pg_stat_statements` module:
   ```plaintext
   shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
   ```
2. Restart PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   ./restart_server.sh
   ```
3. Create the extension in your database:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
   ```

#### **Step 2: Log Execution Times**
Run your query as usual, and then check the execution time:
```sql
SELECT query, total_exec_time, calls
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query LIKE '%FROM Employee%' -- Adjust the filter as needed
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC;
```

---

### **2. Use `\timing` in psql**
If you are running queries via the `psql` command-line tool:
1. Enable timing:
   ```bash
   \timing
   ```
2. Run your query:
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM Employee e 
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM EmployeeProject ep WHERE ep.employee_id = e.id
   );
   ```
3. The execution time will be logged after the query completes.

---

### **3. Use a Timer in pgAdmin**
If youâ€™re using pgAdmin:
1. Go to the Query Tool.
2. Enable **Query Tool -> Preferences -> Query Editor -> Auto Commit**.
3. Run your query.
4. Check the **Messages tab** for execution time:
   ```plaintext
   Execution Time: 0.150 ms
   ```

---

### **4. Use SQL with `clock_timestamp`**
For finer control, you can use SQL to measure the execution time:

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    start_time TIMESTAMP;
    end_time TIMESTAMP;
BEGIN
    start_time := clock_timestamp();

    -- Replace this with your query
    PERFORM * FROM Employee e 
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM EmployeeProject ep WHERE ep.employee_id = e.id
    );

    end_time := clock_timestamp();
    RAISE NOTICE 'Execution Time: % ms', EXTRACT(MILLISECOND FROM (end_time - start_time));
END $$;
```

---

### **Choose the Best Approach**
- **`pg_stat_statements`**: Ideal for tracking multiple queries over time.
- **`\timing`**: Best for quick manual tests in `psql`.
- **SQL with `clock_timestamp`**: Precise for custom timing within your query.
