- **CTE** still edges out **Subquery** and **CASE** on average in “warm” conditions, but the margin is modest (~20–40 ms difference).  
- **CASE** exhibits the slowest “warm” average in this sample, though it has the fastest “cold” average—suggesting some variability or that the data might not be perfectly controlled.  
- Overall, all three approaches remain quite close in performance (roughly half a second to just under a second). If you already favor CTEs for readability or maintainability, these numbers suggest they can be marginally fastest in repeated runs. However, the performance gap is not large enough to overshadow design preferences or clarity.

Based on the comprehensive timing data, here's my recommendation:

1. **CTEs** are the best choice because:
- Most stable performance (lowest standard deviation)
- Consistently good performance after warm-up
- Reached the lowest execution times (492-531ms range)
- Less impacted by server restarts compared to subqueries
- Showed best morning performance averaging 618ms
- More predictable behavior overall

2. Why not the others:
- Subqueries:
  * Higher server restart overhead
  * More variable performance
  * Strong warm-up effect needed
  * Generally higher average execution times

- CASE statements:
  * Showed unpredictable performance spikes (up to 997ms)
  * Highest variability in execution times
  * While average performance was decent, the unpredictability makes it less reliable

Specific Recommendation:
Go with CTEs for this query because:
1. Performance stability is crucial for production environments
2. The performance advantage (especially in the 492-531ms range) is significant
3. Lower impact from server restarts means better reliability during maintenance windows
4. The consistent behavior makes capacity planning more reliable

If you decide to implement this recommendation, I suggest:
1. Run the query during morning hours when possible
2. Implement a simple warm-up query if running after server restart
3. Monitor for any significant deviations from the ~600ms average execution time as an indicator of system health

Recommendation for Query Type

Based on the provided data, here's a recommendation for the query type to use moving forward:
Recommendation: **CTE (Common Table Expression)**

Consistency: CTE queries showed consistent performance, with most queries taking between 500-700 milliseconds.
Performance: CTE queries performed comparably to subquery performance and outperformed case statement queries in some instances.
Readability and Maintainability: CTEs can improve query readability and maintainability by breaking down complex queries into smaller, more manageable pieces.
When to Use Each Query Type:

CTE: Use for complex queries that require breaking down into smaller pieces, or when readability and maintainability are important.
Subquery: Use when a simple, one-time calculation is needed, and performance is critical.
Case Statement: Use when a simple, conditional calculation is needed, and performance is not critical.
Additional Recommendations:

Indexing: Ensure proper indexing on tables used in the queries to improve performance.
Query Optimization: Regularly review and optimize queries to ensure they are performing efficiently.
Server Configuration: Monitor server configuration and adjust as needed to ensure optimal performance.
