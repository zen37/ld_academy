Unfortunately, **`pg_stat_statements` does not store individual records for each query execution**. It aggregates execution statistics (e.g., total execution time, number of calls, average time) for each unique query plan. If you need detailed, per-execution query logs, you'll need to use other PostgreSQL features or external tools.

---

### **Options to Track Individual Query Executions**

#### **1. Use `log_statement` with Query Logging**
PostgreSQL can log each query execution into the server logs using `log_statement` or related settings:

1. **Enable Query Logging**:
   Edit your `postgresql.conf` (in data folder) file and set:
   ```plaintext
   log_statement = 'all'
   log_duration = on
   ```
   Alternatively, for detailed performance logs:
   ```plaintext
   log_min_duration_statement = 0  # Logs all queries and their durations
   ```

2. **Reload Configuration**:
   ```bash
   sudo /Library/PostgreSQL/17/bin/pg_ctl -D /Library/PostgreSQL/17/data reload
   ```

3. **View Logs**:
   Check the PostgreSQL log files (e.g., `/Library/PostgreSQL/17/data/log`) to see detailed information about each query execution.

---

#### **2. Use `pg_stat_activity` for Real-Time Monitoring**
`pg_stat_activity` provides details about currently running queries, including their execution time:

1. Run the following query to monitor active queries:
   ```sql
   SELECT pid, query, state, now() - query_start AS execution_time
   FROM pg_stat_activity
   WHERE state = 'active';
   ```

   While this doesnâ€™t store historical data, you can use it to monitor real-time query execution.

---

#### **3. Use Extensions Like `pg_stat_kcache`**
The `pg_stat_kcache` extension provides detailed execution statistics at the system level. You can combine it with `pg_stat_statements` for more granular tracking.

1. Install and enable `pg_stat_kcache`:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_kcache;
   ```

2. Query detailed statistics (including read/write operations):
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_stat_kcache;
   ```

---

#### **4. Use an External Query Logging Tool**
If detailed, per-execution query logs are critical, consider tools like:
- **pgAudit**: Logs detailed query information, including arguments and execution details.
- **Performance Monitoring Tools** (e.g., pgAdmin, Percona Monitoring, or custom logging frameworks).

---

#### **5. Insert into a Custom Audit Table**
Create a trigger or manually insert query logs into a custom table for each execution:
1. Create a logging table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE query_logs (
       log_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
       query TEXT,
       duration_ms NUMERIC
   );
   ```

2. Log queries manually:
   ```sql
   DO $$
   DECLARE
       start_time TIMESTAMP;
       end_time TIMESTAMP;
   BEGIN
       start_time := clock_timestamp();
       -- Your query here
       PERFORM * FROM Employee e WHERE NOT EXISTS (
           SELECT 1 FROM EmployeeProject ep WHERE ep.employee_id = e.id
       );
       end_time := clock_timestamp();

       INSERT INTO query_logs (query, duration_ms)
       VALUES ('SELECT ...', EXTRACT(MILLISECOND FROM end_time - start_time));
   END $$;
   ```

---

### **Recommendation**
If you need **per-execution query records**:
- Use **`log_min_duration_statement`** for server logs.
- For deeper insights or real-time logging, implement **custom logging with a query log table**.

SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name ~ 'log';

ALTER SYSTEM SET log_rotation_age = '1 min';

ALTER SYSTEM SET log_min_duration_statement = 1;

The log entry you're seeing:
2025-01-19 08:54:00.125 PST [6238] LOG: duration: 0.386 ms
is likely due to the fact that the pg_stat_statements extension is enabled in your PostgreSQL database. This extension tracks execution statistics for all SQL statements executed by the database.
Even though you've set log_statement to 'none', the pg_stat_statements extension is still logging the duration of each statement. This is because the extension is designed to provide detailed statistics on statement execution, and logging the duration is part of that.
To disable logging of statement durations by pg_stat_statements, you can try setting the pg_stat_statements.track parameter to 'none':
SQL
ALTER SYSTEM SET pg_stat_statements.track = 'none';
Alternatively, you can disable the pg_stat_statements extension altogether:
SQL
DROP EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
Keep in mind that disabling pg_stat_statements may make it more difficult to diagnose performance issues or monitor database activity.

If you set log_duration to off, then only statements that exceed the log_min_duration_statement threshold (in your case, 1ms) will be logged.
In other words:
log_duration = on : Logs the duration of every statement, regardless of execution time.
log_duration = off : Logs only statements that exceed the log_min_duration_statement threshold (1ms in your case).
By setting log_duration to off, you can filter out log entries for very short-running statements and only log statements that take longer than 1ms to execute.
