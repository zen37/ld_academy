Concurrency control is a critical aspect of database management systems, ensuring that multiple transactions can run concurrently without interfering with each other. PostgreSQL uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to handle concurrent transactions efficiently, which differs from the typical locking mechanisms used in standard SQL.

### Standard SQL Concurrency Control:
Standard SQL typically uses locking mechanisms to manage concurrency. These mechanisms include:

1. **Locking**:
   - **Exclusive Locks**: Prevent other transactions from accessing the locked data until the lock is released.
   - **Shared Locks**: Allow multiple transactions to read the same data concurrently but prevent modifications.
   - **Update Locks**: Used to indicate that a transaction intends to update the data, preventing other transactions from acquiring exclusive locks.

2. **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**:
   - A protocol that ensures serializability by acquiring all necessary locks before releasing any locks.
   - Divided into a growing phase (acquiring locks) and a shrinking phase (releasing locks).

3. **Deadlock Detection and Resolution**:
   - Mechanisms to detect and resolve deadlocks, where two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for each other to release locks.

### PostgreSQL Concurrency Control with MVCC:
PostgreSQL uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to handle concurrent transactions efficiently. MVCC allows multiple versions of data to coexist, providing several advantages over traditional locking mechanisms.

#### Key Features of MVCC:

1. **Versioning**:
   - Each transaction sees a snapshot of the database at the start of the transaction.
   - Multiple versions of a row can exist simultaneously, allowing concurrent transactions to read consistent data without blocking each other.

2. **Visibility**:
   - A row is visible to a transaction if it was committed before the transaction started and has not been deleted or updated by a concurrent transaction.
   - This ensures that transactions see a consistent view of the database, even as other transactions are modifying the data.

3. **Transaction Isolation Levels**:
   - PostgreSQL supports different transaction isolation levels, including `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, and `SERIALIZABLE`.
   - MVCC allows PostgreSQL to provide high levels of isolation without excessive locking.

4. **Minimal Locking**:
   - MVCC reduces the need for locks, as transactions can read consistent data without blocking other transactions.
   - Writes still require locks, but reads do not, leading to improved concurrency and performance.

5. **Vacuuming**:
   - The `VACUUM` process in PostgreSQL reclaims storage occupied by dead row versions, ensuring that the database does not grow indefinitely.
   - `VACUUM` can be run manually or automatically by the autovacuum daemon.

#### Example of MVCC in Action:

1. **Inserting and Updating Data**:
   ```sql
   BEGIN;
   INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, salary) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 50000);
   COMMIT;

   BEGIN;
   UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE employee_id = 1;
   COMMIT;
   ```

2. **Concurrent Transactions**:
   ```sql
   -- Transaction 1
   BEGIN;
   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 1; -- Sees the original row

   -- Transaction 2 (concurrently)
   BEGIN;
   UPDATE employees SET salary = 60000 WHERE employee_id = 1;
   COMMIT;

   -- Transaction 1 (continued)
   COMMIT; -- Still sees the original row due to MVCC
   ```

3. **Vacuuming**:
   ```sql
   VACUUM employees; -- Reclaims storage occupied by dead row versions
   ```

### Advantages of MVCC:

1. **Improved Concurrency**:
   - Allows multiple transactions to read data concurrently without blocking each other.
   - Reduces contention and improves overall throughput.

2. **Consistent Reads**:
   - Ensures that transactions see a consistent view of the database, even as other transactions are modifying the data.

3. **Reduced Locking**:
   - Minimizes the need for locks, leading to fewer deadlocks and improved performance.

4. **Flexible Isolation Levels**:
   - Supports high levels of transaction isolation without excessive locking.

### Conclusion:
PostgreSQL's use of Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) provides a powerful and efficient mechanism for handling concurrent transactions. By allowing multiple versions of data to coexist and providing consistent reads, MVCC reduces contention and improves overall performance compared to traditional locking mechanisms. This makes PostgreSQL a robust choice for applications requiring high concurrency and consistent data access.
